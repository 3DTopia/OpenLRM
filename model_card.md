# Model Card for OpenLRM V1.1

## Overview

- This model card is for the [OpenLRM](https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM) project, which is an open-source implementation of the paper [LRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04400).
- Information contained in this model card corresponds to [Version 1.1](https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM/releases).

## Notable Differences from the Original Paper

- We do not use the deferred back-propagation technique in the original paper.
- We used random background colors during training.
- The image encoder is based on the [DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) model with register tokens.
- The triplane decoder contains 4 layers in our implementation.
