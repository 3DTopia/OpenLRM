## News

- [2023.12.21] [Hugging Face Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zxhezexin/OpenLRM) is online. Have a try!
- [2023.12.20] Release weights of the base and large models trained on Objaverse.
- [2023.12.20] We release this project OpenLRM, which is an open-source implementation of the paper [LRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04400).

## Setup

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM.git
cd OpenLRM
```

### Environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Pretrained Models

- Model weights are released on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zxhezexin/OpenLRM).
- Weights will be downloaded automatically when you run the inference script for the first time.
- Please be aware of the [license](LICENSE_WEIGHT) before using the weights.

| Model | Training Data | Layers | Feat. Dim | Trip. Dim. | Render Res. | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LRM-Base-Obj | Objaverse | 12 | 1024 | 40 | 192 | [HF](https://huggingface.co/zxhezexin/OpenLRM) |
| LRM-Large-Obj | Objaverse | 16 | 1024 | 80 | 384 | [HF](https://huggingface.co/zxhezexin/OpenLRM) |
| LRM-Base | Objaverse + MVImgNet | 12 | 1024 | 40 | 192 | To be released |
| LRM-Large | Objaverse + MVImgNet | 16 | 1024 | 80 | 384 | To be released |

Model cards with additional details can be found in [model_card.md](model_card.md).

### Prepare Images
- We put some sample inputs under `assets/sample_input`, and you can quickly try them.
- Prepare RGBA images or RGB images with white background (with some background removal tools, e.g., [Rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg), [Clipdrop](https://clipdrop.co)).

### Inference
- Run the inference script to get 3D assets.
- You may specify which form of output to generate by setting the flags `--export_video` and `--export_mesh`.

    ```
    # Example usages
    # Render a video
    python -m lrm.inferrer --model_name lrm-base-obj-v1 --source_image ./assets/sample_input/owl.png --export_video
    
    # Export mesh
    python -m lrm.inferrer --model_name lrm-base-obj-v1 --source_image ./assets/sample_input/owl.png --export_mesh
    ```

## Training
To be released soon.
